                experience and I've taught over 10 million people how to code or how to become professional software
                engineers through my YouTube channel and online courses. I have a Bachelor of Science in Software
                Engineering and a Master of Science in Networks Systems.

                My mission is to make coding and software engineering accessible to everyone through courses that are
                simple to digest, and practical to implement.</div>
